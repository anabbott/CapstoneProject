Here’s directories I’ve worked through so far:
___-_0_1_2_3_4_5_6_7_8-_---0

I moved these files into the directory DataSample and then ran the code blocks in the Notebook.

This created sliced images and then a file list.  I opened the file list in Excel and then looked through the images.  Anywhere we had a curb cut it’s a 1 in first empty column of the file.

What’s a curb cut?  I tried to indicate a 1 for any that was nearly complete.  Several times it fell across a couple of images, so judgement call on which if any to include in.  I did code 1 even for curb cuts that face away from the camera.

WhenI got done I moved the CSV file into the Labels directory with a new unique name.  Doesn’t really matter what the name is as long as unique.
